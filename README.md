### PROBLEM SET (40 points)  
*Do the following in Horstmann’s Big Java Chapter 7:*

Review Exercises (4 points each): R7.7 (R7.3 in 5th Edition) R7.11 (R7.7 in 5th Edition)

Practice Exercise( 20 points): E7.10 (E7.2 in the 5th Edition).  
*Do the following in Schneider and Gersting’s Chapter 7 (Same problem numbers in 6th and 7th Editions):*

Chapter 7 (4 points each):  11, 16 (Use Dijkstra and show your work), 17.  

 **What to hand in:**   

Ror R7.7 and R7.11 and the problems from Schneder and Gersting submit a single pdf file. Name the file ProblemSet4.pdf. For E7.10 you must fill out the included template in your Assignment 4 workspace. You do not need to submit a test class (although you should write one to test your work). We will use our own test class to check each of your methods. 



### PROGRAMMING (60 points)

**Video Poker:**  Do PROGRAMMING PROJECT  Project P7.9 in the 6th Edition of Big Java  (Project  P7.7 in 5th Edition)
 
You must follow the instructions below to receive credit for this assignment. 
 
Instead of your player betting a single token each time, allow the player to bet 1-5 tokens. If a player bets n tokens they win n times as much.  

Your program must use the included templates. These templates are for the classes: Card, Deck, Game, Player, and a test class, TestPoker. You will need to fill-in the existing methods and may want to add more methods and/or instance variables to any or all of these classes except for the test class TestPoker. TestPoker must remain exactly as it is here. 

This project requires you to have two versions of your game each constructed using a different version of the Game constructor. One will require an explicit parameter that you will get as a command-line argument, this is to help you (and us) test your code. That is, it will allow the user to specify the hand that the player gets which will help in testing if your game correctly identifies the various hands. Carefully read the comments in the template files to help you understand how this will work.
 
We will discuss design decisions and more for this project in lecture, so be sure to come to class!
 
Good luck!


**What to hand in**:

Templates for the five source files are located in the Assignment 4 workspace on Codio. In addition to the source files  include a text file named readMe.txt with an explanation of how your program works. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met.   
 

### Submitting your work:

For this assignment you should have three types of files: A single PDF file from the problem set, a single .java file from the problem set, five .java files that are the source code for your program, and a single text file named readMe.txt . The templates for everything but the pdf file are already loaded into your Asignment 4 workspace. You must upload the ProblemSet4.pdf file onto your Assignment 3 workspace. Once you have completed your assignment and uploaded the ProblemSet3.pdf file you just need to switch the completed switch on Codio.

### A word about Grading: 
The question on the prblem set is worth 5 ponts. The programming portion of the assignment is worth 70 points and we will use the following guideline for awarding points:

* 30% if it compiles  
* 30% if it runs properly (expected output for given input, etc.)  
* 20% for style (formatting of code, variable names, comments, etc. Use the style guide posted on Coursworks!)  
* 20% for design (efficiency, short methods, etc.)  

Please make sure your program at least compiles before you submit it! There will be no partial credit for a program that "almost" compiles.
