Poker Design:
    A lot of the design was dictated by what we went over in class. 
        1. Array Lists
            - A manageable way to keep track of decks and card hands
        2. Popping the Stack for Dealing the Deck
            - Taking the top off of each stack and dealing that to the player
            - Increment the top number
        3. Comparable
            - Allows for the Collections.sort() method
        4. Collections.sort()
            - Allows for easy sorting of a hand
        5. Compare To
            - Allows for the Collections.sort() method
        6. Straight Method
            - Looking at the first and last indexes and checking the range
        7. Shuffle Method
            - Using the Collections.shuffle() method
        8. Card Constructor
            - Needs Suit and Value
        9. Test Hand
            - To see if card hand checker works.
